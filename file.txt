For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.

Law: guideline to live according to gods will
•	Law cannot save from sin
•	People assumed that in keeping the law, they were faithful to god. They would boast of their achievements, instead of doing it for god
•	They were still sinning because they lived life according to a law, instead of a establishing a relationship with god thru it
•	Your salvation is by gods grace. But to obtain it, you must have faith in him and live life according to his instructions.
•	For jesus didn’t do away with the law, he fulfilled it.
•	Fulfill: carry out, bring to reality; achieve or realize.
•	He carried out the law and showed the world how to live the law perfectly
•	Romans 7:12: Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.
•	Romans 7:25: So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
•	John 5:46: "For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me. "
Verse 47: "But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words."
•	2nd Peter 3:16: "As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
•	Acts 24:14 But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve [i]the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets;15 having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 
•	Col 2:16 - So don't let anyone pass judgment on you in connection with eating and drinking, or in regard to a Jewish festival or Rosh-Hodesh or Shabbat.
•	Romans 10:5 - For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the Law, "The man who does those things shall live by them."
•	1John 3:4 (KJV) Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the Law: for sin is the transgression of the Law.
•	These arguments against the supremacy of the Mosaic law should not be interpreted to mean that Paul is antinomian, totally against the law. He is, after all, showing that the law had an important place in the redemptive plan of God. But the giving of the law was not the final goal of God's plan. The law was an essential step, but only a step, toward the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises in Christ. Christ is the beginning, end and center of God's plan.
